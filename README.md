# polimetrics

This is a work-in-progress package that contains miscellaneous functions for data analysis - particularly for political science/survey data. Most of them have been written either because they are of use in my research or because I thought it would be an interesting challenge.

## Installation

You can install this package by running the following code in R:

library(devtools)  
install_github("philswatton/philspackage")
